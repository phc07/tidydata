Introduction
	XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
	Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
	Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass 
	Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
 
	Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
	(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 
	(tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

	Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals 
	producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
	(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

	These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
	'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
